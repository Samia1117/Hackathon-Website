Dtech Hackathon 09-10 July 2021
Chosen track: Women's Health and Social Good

Description:
Project created about Women's Reproductive Health for HackDtech2021, 
a hackathon hosted by Duke University's Duke Technology Scholars program.

What technology we built:
This was first time participation for all but one of us, so we built a simple interactive website.

Further description of our technology:
It is an informational and recommendation based website to help women by directing them to with resources 
such as nearby hospital locations, links to CDC guidelines about pregnancy and menstruation, etc.
The website also attempts to make recommendations based on the particular information that the user inputs on search bars.
However, this of the website aspect is incomplete, as we did not have time to incorporate 
a feature such as a full-fledged recommendation engine.
