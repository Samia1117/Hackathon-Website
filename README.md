Dtech Hackathon 09-10 July 2021
Chosen track: Women's Health and Social Good

Description:
Project created about Women's Reproductive Health for HackDtech2021, 
a hackathon hosted by Duke University's Duke Technology Scholars program.

This was first time participation for all but one of us, so we built a simple interactive website.

It is an informational and recommendation based website for women to help them with resources such as nearby hospital locations,
links to CDC guidelines about pregnancy and menstruation, and also attempts to make recommendations
based on the particular information that the user inputs.
However, this aspect is left incomplete, as we did not have time to incorporate a feature such as a full-fledged recommendation engine.
