Dtech Hackathon 09-10 July 2021

Project created about reproductive health for HackDtech2021, a hackathon hosted by Duke University's Duke Technology Scholars program.
This was first time participation for all but one of us, so we built a simple interactive website for women to help them with resources
and information regarding Women's Health.
Our chosen track (out of 3) was: Women's Health and Social Good
